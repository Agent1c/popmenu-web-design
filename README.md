# Challenge 1 – Designing a Website
## Background
Restaurant owners are busy people and do not always provide all the necessary information to build a website that effectively attracts customers. Onboarding Consultants gather details from clients, but as Web Designers, we often need to fill in gaps to ensure a
compelling and functional design.

## Client Information
    • Client Name: Seafood Boiler
    • Business Type: Fast-casual seafood restaurant
    • Target Audience: Young adults and families
    • Logo Provided: Link Here

## Your Objective
    • Design a home page mockup using an image editor of your choice.
    • Include design rationale in your presentation.
    • Prepare follow-up questions for the Onboarding Consultant to ask the client after the initial site preview, ensuring key design details are not overlooked.
