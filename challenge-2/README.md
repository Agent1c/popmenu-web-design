# Challenge 2 – Critiquing a Website

1. Header
    - The header section needed to be improved from the logo—it needed to be a little bigger and clearer, including the navigation menu.
    - Banner/Hero section The banner lake attraction and the text used needed to be consistent and match the food theme. It could be improved by centering the text, fixing the heading text, using a cleaner font, and light bold.

2. Join Us Section
    - The Join Us section has 2 different backgrounds, of which the other was sized small. The purple color could have been used alone or the gray color. The content needed to be properly centered,  fonts needed(1.3em) to be enlarged as same as the heading.
    - the button needs to be aligned in the center.
3. Enjoy Fujiyama Section
    - The section is plain empty. It makes it difficult for a user to know exactly what he/she is ordering because the menu is empty, needing a little bit of mini icons or small images to give an idea of what to expect.
4. Survey section
    - The survey section is not properly aligned, and the company logo is not visible enough, needs to be centered properly, then fix the size of it, have at least 1 color that goes or blends together with the brand company.
5. Footer
    - On the footer section, the company's logo needs to be more visible, the Become A Vip needs to be properly aligned with the whole content in the footer, it is floating making it very unpleasant for a user to enjoy the content.
